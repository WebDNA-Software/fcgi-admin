# fcgi-admin
Admin directory for a WebDNA fcgi installation
==========================
This admin system has been built with boostrap v4.3.1. It has been developed to provide a new updated look to the administration of WebDNA fcgi plus provide developers with a framework to expand the administration to suit their own needs.

Installation is a simple replacement of the originally installed version.
1) Backup the Admin directory that was originally installed with WebDNA.
2) Upload this entire directory to the root of your WebDNA fast cgi installation, this is typically /var/www/html/website_root/WebDNA
